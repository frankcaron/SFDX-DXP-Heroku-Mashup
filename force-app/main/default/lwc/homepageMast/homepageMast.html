                        <p>Hi. My name is Frank, and I love helping technical teams and team leaders use software to build better businesses.</p>

                        <p>I like to describe myself as a scribe, curator, organizer, and collaborator. Those are all just really euphemisms to dress up my OCD, which manifests as a compulsive need to write stuff down, talk stuff out, and get stuff done.</p>


                        <p>I am currently living and working in <a href="https://www.salesforce.com" target="new">New York City</a> with my wonderful fianc√© Vanessa. I've previously lived and worked in <a href="https://www.touchbistro.com" target="new">Toronto</a>, <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/" target="new">Waterloo</a>, <a href="https://www.stormpath.com" target="new">San Francisco</a>, and almost <a href="http://www.contentful.com" target="new">Berlin</a>.</p>


                        <p>I come from a background in app and web development. This experience has been complemented over the years with a passion for information architecture as it applies to both user and developer experience.</p>

                        <blockquote class="quote">
                            Frank is very skilled with a strong technical background, but he is also extremely articulate and has a very sharp eye for design and interface.

                        <p>I've spent the last decade working as a technical product manager and a product marketer. I've managed and taken to market upwards of $100MM in product, and I've shipped a lot of shit to a lot of different customers. Most of the battles were hard-fought; few were sexy.</p>

						<blockquote class="quote">
                            Frank is a superstar product manager, writer and hacker. It's truly rare to find someone with a blend of technical knowhow, deep passion for collaboration, and award-worthy writing and communication skills. He's never afraid to speak his mind, challenge status quo and push to get the right thing done for all of our stakeholders.

                        <p>Contrasting these technical skills is my formal education and a wealth of experience as a professional writer. From technical doc to editorial feature writing, product requirements to product reviews, I am proud to be a flexible and versatile writer, with a half-decent business acumen to boot.</p>

                        <blockquote class="quote">
                            Frank is a conscientious, detail-oriented and hard worker. He writes with personality and flair.

                        <p>Today, I've transitioned into the role I was born to play: corporate storytelling. I'm finally and successfully exploiting my weird melange of skills to help customers learn, leverage, and love the tools my company creates.</p>

                        <p>All told, I love software products, and if I believe in yours, I'm all in: days, nights, and weekends.</p>
