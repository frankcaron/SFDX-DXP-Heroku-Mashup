# JavaScript-Only Salesforce DXP Portal

This repo contains a working Salesforce DXP (formerly Communities) portal built entirely with JavaScript via [Lightning Web Components](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/documentation/en/lwc) and the new [Custom Lightning Web Component Template for DXP](https://releasenotes.docs.salesforce.com/en-us/spring20/release-notes/rn_networks_developers_lwc.htm).
